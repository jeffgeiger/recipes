# Jeff's heavily plagiarized meatloaf

### Meat Ingredients
*  2lbs ground beef (90% lean)
*  2 eggs
*  1 small yellow onion, chopped to oblivion
*  3 garlic cloves, minced
*  3Tbsp ketchup
*  3/4cup panko bread crumbs
*  1/3cup milk (I use whole)
*  1.5tsp salt
*  1.5tsp Italian seasoning
*  1/4tsp ground black pepper
*  1/2tsp smoked paprika
*  (optional) A couple shakes of Mrs. Dash isn't too bad either.

### Glaze Ingredients
*  3/4cup ketchup
*  1.5tsp white vinegar
*  2.5Tbsp brown sugar
*  1tsp garlic powder
*  1/2tsp onion powder
*  1/4tsp ground black pepper
*  1/4tsp salt
*  1-2Tbsp yellow mustard (I add this last, to taste, but it's usually "one heavy squirt")

### Preparation:

Preheat oven to 375ยบ and line or grease a 9x5 loaf pan.  

Mix all the meat ingredients together. Mix thoroughly. (Seriously.)  

Drop the loaf in the bread pan and shape it so none of the sides are touching the pan. Bake at 375ยบ for 40 minutes.  

Mix all the glaze ingredients together. (Mustard to taste) After the initial 40 minutes of baking is done, glaze the loaf and return it to the over for 20 minutes.  

When you pull it from the oven, let it sit 10-20 minutes. Slice and serve.

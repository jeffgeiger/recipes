# Not Jeff's Veggie Pizza
(Copied from the Nebraska Lion's Cookbook. My mom's recipe, so, "fair use" or something.)

### Ingredients

#### "Crust":
*  2 cans crescent roll dough  

#### "Sauce":
*  2 8oz packages cream cheese
*  1.5Tbsp dill weed
*  1tsp garlic powder
*  3/4cup mayonnaise (real mayo)
*  1/4cup milk

#### "Toppings":
*  1cup chopped broccoli
*  1cup chopped cauliflower
*  1/2cup chopped green onion
*  1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar)

### Preparation

Press crescent dough into a jelly roll pan. (I don't know what that is, so I use a cookie sheet.)  

Bake at 350ยบ for 8-12 minutes, just until it's /about/ to brown. Let cool completely.  

While the "crust" is cooling, mix together the "sauce" ingredients. When the "crust" is cool, cover it with the "sauce", and then top it with the "toppings".  

Let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.
